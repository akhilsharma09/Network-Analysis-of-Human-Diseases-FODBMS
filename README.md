# Network-Analysis-of-Human-Diseases-FODBMS



Files in the repository:
1. Report.pdf - It contains the step wise explanation of the job done on the dataset (Disease.csv) and the entire working as a manual.
2. Disease.csv - The raw dataset of all the linked nodes in a .csv file.





**Introduction & About**

For the network analysis, we chose to focus on a network of human diseases and gene types. We wanted to not only explore the visualization but also to discover specific gene types and their relationship to diseases. We also wanted to understand the links between neurological diseases because many people were diagnosed with these types of diseases specifically Alzheimerâ€™s and Dementia.

Software Used: Gephi**

**Reflections**

Overall, we found this lab to be quite challenging as well as informative. We were not so precisely familiar with Gephi before this lab assignment and found the software to be not particularly user-friendly. It took us several attempts to truly create the visualization that we wanted. We did like the ability to adjust the layout and appearance of the visualization with a variety of properties. We also liked being able to drill down on a particular disease to see what was linked to it and being surprised by these findings.
In the future, we would like to see what other layouts we could use for this dataset. We think it would be interesting to see how I could display the networks of diseases in a variety of ways. We would also like to use Gephi to explore other datasets to see what insights we could derive. We also want to explore other network visualization software particularly those that are more user-friendly and easier to navigate.
